# Pandemic & Pandemic: Legacy

Pandemic is a cooperative board game designed by Matt Leacock and published by Z-Man Games in 2007.

It is based on the premise that four diseases have broken out in the world, each threatening to wipe out a region. The game accommodates 2 to 4 players and is unlike most boardgames as the gameplay is cooperative, rather than competitive. Through the combined effort of all the players, the goal is to discover all four cures before any of several game-losing conditions are reached.
